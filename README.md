## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Hey! So I did this project a while back and finally had some time to go through the code and make a few tweaks. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it. The layout is similar to some of my other projects, so it was fun to practice and get better at it. I totally forgot to comment the code, but I think it's still easy enough to understand.

As usual, I went with the mobile-first approach, which I think is the best way to go. The project looks really cool and seems more complicated than it actually is. I always feel really proud of myself when I finish a project, and this one is no exception. Plus, I'm feeling more and more comfortable with this stuff, so that's awesome.

This is the final Newbie challenge, and I am pleased to announce that I have successfully completed all 18 of them! I didn't have a specific timeframe in mind, but I managed to finish them all in about two weeks, which is awesome considering that I started from scratch.
i know this might sound a little bit cocky but i am really proud of myself :D

I'm feeling super determined and ready to keep this momentum going. It feels really good to accomplish something like this, and it's definitely motivating me to keep improving my skills.

I'm excited to start my first Junior project! I'm planning on finishing all of them in a month and a half. I want to stick with CSS, HTML, and vanilla javascript for now, just to get a really solid grasp of the basics before moving on to anything else. It's important to build a strong foundation, you know? Marathon, not a sprint, and all that.

So, I checked out the Junior projects already and they look pretty challenging, but I'm ready to tackle them! Bring on the challenges!


### Continued development

I do not intend to make any further additions to this project as I believe it is complete, and I am satisfied with the outcome. I am committed to advancing my skills and knowledge by embarking on new projects and honing my abilities.
